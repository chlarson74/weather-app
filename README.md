## Description 

[View the webpage](https://chlarson74.github.io/weather-app)

The project is a dynamic weather report application. It utilizes openweathermap.org to supply the data that is parsed into the webpage. When a city is searched the web page will display the current weather of the city and a 5 day forecast. 

Work completed:
- Utilized openweathermap.org to dynamically update the weather data for current weather and a 5 day forecast.
- Created an element for the necessary information to append to on a click eventListener.
- Provided a clean user interface with a video background for visual appeal.



## Usage 

Webpage deployed online is accessible through a web browser like Google Chrome.


## Learning Points 
- I learned how to utilize data that is provided by a third party api to dynamically update information on my website.
- I furthered my understanding of connecting the dynamic functions of javascript to element in the HTML document
- The DayJS third-party was helpful in bringing in more dynamic elements
- I worked to research and grow my understanding of localStorage in order to retain information.
- Spent a lot of time trying to debug and discover failing issues within my javascript. 
- More research and learning is clearly required.
