## Description 

[View the webpage](https://chlarson74.github.io/daily-planner)

The project is a dynamic daily planner webpage that will visually show the hours of the work day - past, present and future by color. The data that the user puts into the hour fields will be stored in localStorage and can be retained even through refreshing the page. 

Work completed:
- Utilized DayJS to dynamically update the date
- Created a time block for each work hour of the day for the user to store and retain information within.
- Each hour block of the day will dynamically update by color. As the hours pass the future, present and past hours will have new colors.
- I was given the HTML, CSS and an incomplete JS file. I used jQuery methodes to update the JS file. There were some IDs that I need to add to the HTML document.



## Usage 

Webpage deployed online is accessible through a web browser like Google Chrome.


## Learning Points 

- I furthered my understanding of connecting the dynamic functions of javascript to element in the HTML document
- I learned to use third-party resources to include within the JS file.
- The DayJS third-party was helpful in bringing in more dynamic elements
- I furthered my understanding of localStorage to retain information
- I learned and utilzed the simplified javascript library jQuery
